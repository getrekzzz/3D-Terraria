# World generation

Deterministic from `(seed, size, GenVersion)`. Two tiers:

1. **Plan** (`WorldPlan`, built once, cheap): 1/8-resolution landness/height/ruggedness grids, biome regions
   (Terraria layout: spawn at the centre, snow and jungle on opposite sides, dungeon on the snow side, desert
   with an underground sandstone body, evil patches, an ocean ring), structure placements and spline features
   (worm tunnels, shafts, rivers, lava tubes) indexed per chunk in a `FeatureIndex`, ore choices, spawn.
   Only the plan hash is saved; the plan is rebuilt from the seed on load.
2. **Chunk passes** (pure functions of plan + chunk coordinate) fill a padded 34³ context. A chunk generated
   alone equals the same chunk generated inside a region (purity test), so chunks generate in any order on
   any thread.

Passes (`PassRegistry`, in order): 1 global density · 2 continents · 3 geological layers · 4 biome masks ·
5 caves (cheese/spaghetti lattices + plan worms) · 6 large caverns · 7 underground rivers · 8 ores ·
9 structures (cabins, mineshafts, living trees, pyramid, mini-biomes) · 10 dungeon · 11 jungle · 12 hostile
biome · 13 underworld · 14 floating islands · 15 ocean · 16 treasure · 17 ecology · 18 decoration ·
19 navigation (face connectivity, walkable cells) · 20 simulation init.

Layer bands (fractions of height): underworld < 0.14 · cavern < 0.49 · underground < 0.625 · sea 0.66 ·
sky ≥ 0.80 · space ≥ 0.93. Sizes (cells, 0.5 m): Tiny 512³, Small 2048×768×2048, Medium 4096×1024×4096,
Large 6144×1024×6144.

Determinism rules: SplitMix/PCG32 streams derived from names (`SeedTree`), never call order; no
`Math.Sin/Pow/Exp` in generation (polynomial `Trig`); vendored FastNoiseLite. Golden chunk hashes
(`WorldGenTests.GeneratedChunksMatchTheirGoldenHashes`) guard unintended changes; a deliberate change bumps `GenVersion` (existing saves keep their edited chunks and
regenerate the rest with the new generator, with a logged warning).

**World mutations** (hardmode) are a third, lazy tier: an ordered log of steps saved with the world, each a pure
function of (world, mutation seed, chunk, blocks). `WorldSession.Produce` applies whatever a chunk is missing (freshly
generated chunks start at level 0; saved chunks store their level), and loaded chunks are caught up live, so a region
first visited long after hardmode looks exactly as if it had been loaded at the moment the world changed. Ore veins
for both generation and mutations come from the same `VeinStamper`.

Inspect with `dotnet run --project tools/Strata.Tools -- worldgen-report --seed=N --size=tiny`
(top-down biome map, cross-sections, ore-by-depth charts).

**Terrain metrics** (`WorldGen/Analysis`). `SurfaceProfile.Measure` generates the chunks around the surface of a
window (per chunk column, surface bounds sampled every 4 cells) and records per column the highest solid cell (Top),
scanning from `SurfaceHeight` + 24 down to − 24, plus flags: *lip* (topmost solid run ≤ 6 cells thick over open space:
overhangs, thin roofs), *floating* (solid cells with ≥ 2 open cells under them within 12 cells of Top, counted),
*breach* (Top more than 3 cells below `TerrainField.SurfaceHeight`: trenches, caves breaking through) and *water*
(liquid on Top). `TerrainStats` aggregates a histogram of |ΔTop| between 4-neighbours (0/1/2/3/4–7/8+), p95/p99/max
step, lip %, floating cells per 10k columns, breach %, water %, roughness (mean |second difference| of Top on both
axes), relief (mean standard deviation of Top in 128² blocks, which guards against "smoothing" by flattening) and the
same per surface biome (≥ 256 columns). worldgen-report measures a `--terrain-window=N` square (default 512, centred
on spawn, clamped to the world; 0 skips it), adds a `terrain` object to stats.json and paints `terrain_hillshade.png`
(1 px per column, lit from the north-west, biome map colours) and `terrain_flags.png` (grey hillshade; red lips,
yellow floating, blue breaches, cyan water; white dot = spawn). The metric definitions are frozen so reports stay
comparable: never tune them inside a terrain change.

Evidence for a terrain change: run the report on the parent commit with `--out=build/wg-before`, then on the change
with `--out=build/wg-after --compare=build/wg-before/stats.json`, which prints metric / before / after / delta
(overall, step buckets and per biome) and writes it to `terrain_compare.txt`. `build/` is gitignored, so paste the
table and the two terrain PNGs into the PR or commit message. Options take `--key=value` or `--key value`.

## Blueprint op index and zone fast path

`Blueprint.Freeze()` (called by the `StructureFeature` constructor, idempotent and thread-safe) builds an immutable
per-chunk index: every op is listed under each chunk whose padded generation volume (core plus `ChunkGenContext.Pad`)
its bounds touch, in original op order. `FeatureCarver.Stamp` and `StructureFeature.InZone` only visit
`OpIndicesFor(chunk)`, so a dungeon of thousands of ops costs a dictionary lookup per chunk or zone query. A frozen
blueprint rejects new ops. `CarveOp`/`FillOp` carry `NoZone`: approach cuts and steps outside a building are stamped
but are not "in the structure" for spawns, music or mining locks. The index changes no output (golden hashes
unchanged; `BlueprintIndexTests` compares it with brute force).
