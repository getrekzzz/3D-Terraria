# Gameplay systems

* **Items** — `ItemUseTable` infers actions from stats (pick/axe/hammer power, place targets, projectiles,
  healing) plus explicit `behaviors`. `ItemUseSystem` enforces use time, auto-reuse and reach, and performs
  mining (brush sized by `mineBrush`, precision mode = 1 cell), chopping, hammer reshaping, block/object
  placement (shape + facing rotation), consumption (healing fatigue, permanent life/mana caps) and shooting
  (ammo classes, mana).
* **World editing** — `WorldEditor`: accumulated block damage vs hardness/pick power, drops, loose blocks
  falling, objects losing support, object hit points and loot, container contents, remeshing via the
  streamer. `Targeting` is a voxel DDA that also hits tile objects.
* **Crafting** — `RecipeBook` (indexed, atomic crafts) + `CraftingEnvironment` (stations within reach,
  nearby liquids, biome/time conditions).
* **Combat** — `DamageModel` (class bonuses, ±15 % variance, defence × difficulty factor, crits, knockback
  resistance). `MeleeSystem` sweeps swing arcs/thrusts over the use animation (one hit per creature per
  swing); `ProjectileSystem` handles gravity, drag, terrain bounces, pierce and on-hit effects.
* **Creatures** — `NpcSystem` runs brains (`SlimeHop`, `Walker`, `Flyer`, `Idle`, created from the enemy's
  `brain` spec), AABB voxel movement, contact damage with player i-frames and knockback, buffs with damage
  over time, death loot and coins, despawning far from players. `SpawnDirector` evaluates data-driven spawn
  rules at candidate ground cells with layer/biome/time/light context (tuning: `data/config/spawning.json`).
* **Events and bosses** — `EventDirector` rolls data-driven events at dusk/dawn (`data/events.json`) and
  feeds them to spawn-rule conditions; bosses are enemies with a `boss` block (arena radius, day despawn,
  segments for worms) driven by `GelSovereign`, `Watcher` and `Worm` brains; `summonBoss` items check
  conditions and spawn them.
* **Liquids** — `LiquidSimulator` (Simulation/Liquids) is a cellular automaton over *active* cells only:
  cells woken by edits (`VoxelWorld.Edited`), by a chunk loading next to them (`WorldSession.ChunkInstalled`
  scan that wakes only cells that could move), or by their own flow. Each liquid steps every `flowInterval`
  ticks: react with other liquids (`mixes` → obsidian, honey blocks), fall up to `fallCells`, share sideways
  with neighbours at least `spreadThreshold` levels lower (never thinner than `minLevel`), evaporate thin
  remnants. One edit batch per step keeps saving, sky map, lighting (lava's `light`) and remeshing (border
  cells dirty neighbour chunks) consistent. `LiquidEffects` applies contact damage/buffs (lava burns, honey
  sweetens, water clears `fire` buffs), `liquidImmune` effects, drag/buoyancy on drops and item
  incineration. Buckets are the `bucket` behaviour (scoop from a pool's surface, pour with overflow up).
  All liquid properties live in `data/liquids.json`; the voxel byte stores code (1–7) + level (0–31).
* **Players** — `PlayerState` (inventory, equipment effects, buffs, vitals, spawn points) is saved per
  character; `PlayerEntity` is the in-world body the engine syncs; death → 5 s → respawn at bed or spawn.

## Commands, probes and smoke scripts
`CommandRegistry` (Core) + `EngineCommands` (Godot). Probes are named numbers (`player.life`, `inv.<item>`,
`npcs.<enemy>`, `block.dx.dy.dz`, `liquid.dx.dy.dz`, `near.<block>`, `liquid.active`, `stream.idle`, `errors`, …) used by `assert` and `wait_until`.
`game/Testing/Scripts/*.cmds` run headless in CI with `--smoke=` and print `SMOKE PASS`/`SMOKE FAIL`;
`--exec="cmd;cmd"` runs commands at startup (screenshots, manual testing). Runner directives: `wait`,
`wait_until <probe> <op> <value> [timeout]`, `hold <action> <seconds>`, `repeat <n> <command>`.
